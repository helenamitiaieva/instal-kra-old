# Instal-Kra — Commercial Website (Old Version)

This repository contains the **old version** of a commercial landing page for a Polish company in the plumbing & heating industry.

It was developed as my **first implementation** of the project, focusing mainly on building the full layout and structure of the website.  
At this stage, the project was created in a simpler format — with **all HTML and CSS written in a single file** (no modular separation yet).

💡 This version is kept on GitHub to demonstrate progress and to compare it with the updated implementation.
